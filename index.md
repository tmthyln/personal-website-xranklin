# Hey there!

I'm a computer scientist researching machine learning. 
I'm interested in why and when deep learning works (its inductive biases),
empirically investigating curious properties of neural networks, and
effective visualizations and explanations (or interpretability).
I've also done a little bit of work with graph analytics and visualization.

## What I'm Currently Working On

* a few machine learning research projects
* open source development of a suite of packages in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) for working with 
  the Chinese language:
  * JuliaCJK family of packages: [ZhuyinPinyin.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/ZhuyinPinyin.jl),
    [CEDICT.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/CEDICT.jl),
    [CJKFrequencies.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/CJKFrequencies.jl), 
    [IDSGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/IDSGraphs.jl) $\rightarrow$
    [UnifiedChineseDictionary.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/UnifiedChineseDictionary.jl)
